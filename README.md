# Linear_Regression_Bike_Sharing_Assignment
> BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider in the US, has experienced a decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They want to develop a business plan to accelerate their revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy improves. To achieve this, they have hired a consulting company to analyze a dataset on daily bike demands and identify the significant variables that affect demand for their service in the American market. The company wants to know which variables are important in predicting demand and how well they describe the bike demands.
